To obtain full credit on the assignment your submission should match the functionality of the demonstration. The following criteria must be adhered to as well as satisfying all items on this assignment's rubric.
Open the js/main.js file.
All uses of alert() must be removed
An object with three properties(keys) is created for both fighters. The three properties are:
name
damage
health
Example: fighter1 = {name:Spiderman, damage:20, health:100};
Both fighter objects should be in an array
Modify fight() function



Since this assignment is now using objects, the code in the fight() function must be modified from the previous version of the assignment to accommodate for this. NO loop will be needed!-since clicking on the button is what triggers the next round.
Replace the alerts with code that access the DOM(HTML) such as getElemetById and/or querySelector

Use JavaScript's innerHTML property to change the text in the HTML. The following information will be displayed dynamically in the HTML (view the demonstration again to see how this should look):
Fighter's name and health at the top
Current round number above the button
Create a click event on the button
When the button is clicked, the following should commence:
advance round
the modified fight() function is called
Disable the button when the game is over and make sure the appropriate "game over message" is shown at the top. The message should be one of the following:
Fighter 1 wins
Fighter 2 wins
Both Fighters Die
Make sure the actual name of the fighter is shown not fighter1 or fighter2. You can always change the message to something else if you want to be more creative.
Good Luck!
